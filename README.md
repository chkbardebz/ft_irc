Welcome to our ft_irc (Internet Relay Chat)

It's a server program that creates chatrooms like a forum with topics you can specifie

We're doing this project together with aPoet and myself

The program works with two arguments : 
    - port : The port number on which the IRC server will be listening for incoming IRC connections
    - password : The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries to connect to the server

When the program is running, you can use these 4 Commands :
    - KICK
    - INVITE
    - TOPIC
    - MODE
        . i
        . t
        . k
        . o
        . l

Hope you enjoy !
